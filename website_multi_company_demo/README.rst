====================================
 Demo Data for "Real Multi Website"
====================================


We put it in a separate module, because we don't want to add website_sale to dependency in website_multi_company.

If you are looking for *Mult Website* feature use module `Real Multi Website <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/website_multi_company_demo>`_ instead.

Notes
=====

* After first login website domains are updated. See `<models/res_users.py>`_
